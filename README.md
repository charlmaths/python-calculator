## Instructions and Notes

The idea of this project is to build a simple calculator to practise **logic** and **loops**.

I have been using Python for some time now, and this project is intended to practise the fundamentals with minimal help from A.I. The goal is to write the code myself, reinforce core concepts, and use A.I. primarily to explore and clarify ideas rather than to generate solutions. All of the code is written by me.

Once the project is fully developed, I may use tools such as Copilot or other A.I. systems for autocompletion, but the core logic and structure will originate from my own work. I will also make a point of clearly highlighting where A.I. has been used.

We will start simple and gradually extend the functionality to see how far it can be taken! It's kinda fun to do it this way!

## Version control (git)

Again, will try to replicate a professional environment here, i.e. will create a short feature branch, requesting PR then merging! :D

## Version 1

The program should prompt the user to choose one of the following operations:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

This version focuses on:

- A very simple use of a `while` loop
- Basic `if` / `elif` statements
- No use of functions

The goal is to understand control flow and looping logic before introducing more advanced concepts.
